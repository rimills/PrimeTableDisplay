To run:

When you open the program, you will be asked to enter the number
of primes you wish the table to be made up of. From there, the
program should execute and display the table of multiples of
prime numbers, as requested.

What went well:
In my opinion, I feel that I was able to make a solid number of
commits to github, showing the progress that my code and 
submission took. This is especially considering that I had 
recently been having problems getting github to accept code
to commit to github.

What I would have done with more time:
There are a few of things I would have done more time, but the
two main things I wished to do was to allow the user to 
repeat the process for multiple iterations of the program 
(the issue being is that this would require a fundamental
change in the way the program was coded, which would take more
time than I had) and to be able to adequately test whether or 
not the .jar file worked as expected.The issue here is that
the operating system I am using not being reasonably able to
test code outside of a suitable IDE. There are ways to work
around this, but again it would require a fundamental overhaul
in the way the program was coded, which would require more time.

For reference, time itself was not so much an issue with this
project. The more pressing issue was the heavy amount of other
work that was required around the same time, meaning that
very little time could be spent on the project.
